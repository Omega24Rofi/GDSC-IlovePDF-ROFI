This is a project that i've been working on for front-end study case for hacker role member in GDSC UGM, iLovePDF itself like it's name is a website that you can use for converting file to pdf or pdf to another types of files. In this project try to copying the UI of the website and its responsive design, so this web clone that i made has no function to do file conversetion.
# Directory
In this repsitory it has a couple of folder and sub-folder, as you can see on the root folder it contains main file like index.html and styles.css, also folder like img, page, and style. So i this is the function of the file and the folder :

1. Index.html

   This file is the main file of the web, this file contains the main webpage UI.

2. Styles.css

   This file is the css or styling sheet of the Index.html and also for the all page in the repository, without this file the webpage will look plain and not intresting.
